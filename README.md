# Nosedive
A cross-platform app for use in research experiments on reputation effects in social interactions.

### Overview of Project
#### Inspiration
Ant Financial implemented the Zhima (Sesame) Credit System in China in 2015, using data from Alibaba’s variety of resources, including purchases and social media connections, to derive a national social credit system. The Chinese government hopes that, as the system expands and gains traction across the country, it will effectively govern the civil behavior of its citizens. The quality of each individual’s credit rating determines their access to bank loans and certain private schools, and can result in discounts or bans from airlines, trains, and hotels. In theory, the significant influence of these social credit ratings should motivate individuals to seek self-improvement through a moral and commendable lifestyle. However, the effects of such a system could affect the overall quality of life of its members. As portrayed in a 2016 episode of the Netflix series *Black Mirror* titled "Nosedive," a  social credit rating system can play on modern society’s obsession with social comparisons and reputation to have severe consequences on social relationships. The implications enforce a national culture of judgment with both incentives and consequences that could alter the way people approach social interactions. This dystopian depiction of a hypothetical social credit system acts as the main motivation for a set of experiments on reputation effects in social interactions, and this app, created for use in these experiments, takes inspiration from the social rating app portrayed in the episode.
